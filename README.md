CARTO complete Training Course
==============================

## [http://bit.ly/carto-workshop](http://bit.ly/carto-workshop)

This repository contains all material and links for a complete CARTO training course.

## [Day 1](01-builder-visualization/README.md). CARTO BUILDER I: Data visualizations and Styling

This course will cover different BUILDER (CARTO's web interface) workflows for generating cartographic data visualizations. We'll dig into new Builder features and some differences with old Editor. During this first part, we'll cover those aspects related to data visualizations, cartographic styles, legend's definition and dashboard creation with actionable Widgets that interact with the map. 

## [Day 2](02-builder-analysis/README.md). CARTO BUILDER II: Geospatial analysis and prediction

This advanced workshop will let users know the most powerful analytic capabilities of CARTO BUILDER. Analysis workflows and its link with Widgets will occupy the central part of the course, along with a review of the different analyses that BUILDER currently offers.

## [Day 3](03-cartography/README.md). Cartography and advanced simbology

This session focuses on the advanced use of BUILDER, creating cartographic rules for powerful webmap visualizations. It also goes through our new tools for thematic mapping (TurboCARTO) and all the different options that Torque offers for creating dynamic maps.

## [Day 4](04-database/README.md). Geospatial databases and CARTO platform

This workshop extensively covers advanced use of PostgreSQL and PostGIS for those cases when Builder is not enough. We'll review the most relevant parts of SQL language, useful for advanced analysis development, as well as the geospatial capabilities brought by PostGIS. We'll also cover some basic concepts for task automation, as triggers and stored procedures.

Second part of this course will introduce CARTO architecture as a webmapping platform, deploying options and main components. The different APIs for interacting with the platform, most usual workflows and use cases will be covered too.

## [Day 5](05-sdks/README.md). Develop with CARTO: CARTO.js, Mobile SDK and Python SDK

In this last lesson, we'll cover different SDK's that we could use for developing applications with CARTO.
Javascript SDK (CARTO.js) is the most relevant and will be covered in depth for creating web applications that work over CARTO APIs. 
A Mobile SDK introduction will follow, allowing the development of native CARTO mobile apps. 
Last but not least, we'll finish the course with some examples and exercise that make use of our Python SDK.
