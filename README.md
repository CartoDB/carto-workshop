CARTO Training Course for Valencia Techfest 2017
==================================================

## [http://bit.ly/170503-carto-techfest](http://bit.ly/170503-carto-techfest)

This training was designed as a **3** hours training for [Valencia Techfest 2017](http://www.ctranspa.webs.upv.es/techfest/).

In order to access the complete training on CARTO technologies, you have to go to [the master branch](http://bit.ly/carto-workshop). The contents are separated into modules and are meant to be made sequentially going from the most basic usage for GIS and analysts up to the advanced development section for attendants with more knowledge about web mapping development and so on. Modules can be easily combined to finally make a 1 week full training but they can be also split to make a longer training with half day duration.

This course will cover the basics and workflows of BUILDER (CARTO's web interface) for generating cartographic data visualizations. We'll dig into new BUILDER features and some differences with old Editor. During this first part, we'll cover those aspects related to data visualizations, cartographic styles, legend's and popups definition, analysis and dashboard creation with actionable Widgets that interact with the map.

### Exercise: Valencia trees dashboard

The idea of this exercise is to replicet the SF tree map using Valencia tree inventory from the city open data portal, so you create a map that allows to explore the different types of trees and their species, as well as the total number of trees. See the following screenshot to get an idea of the final result you should achieve.
