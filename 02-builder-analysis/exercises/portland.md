<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->


## 1. Import and create map

### 1. 1. Import ``customer_home_locations`` csv.

* Use the `NEW DATASET` wizard to import the table.

### 1. 2. Click on ``CREATE MAP`` from the ``customer_home_locations``.

### 1. 3. Rename ``customer_home_locations`` to ``Customer home locations`` and change the title of the map to ``Sales Territories (Portland) Demo``.

> **Warning**: after renaming a layer a error could pop up saying "the map cannot be rendered", don't worry about this. Refresh the page and it will dissapear.


* You should have a dashboard like this:

## 2. Layer styling: first view

On this example we will start with a single color styling and fixed marker size.

* Change the fill color to ``#cc1035`` and set the size of the markers to 7.
* Set the stroke of the points to 0.
* Switch to `VALUES` to `CARTOCSS`. Take a look on the CartoCSS properties and try to change any of them like increasing the width of the marker.

## 3. Analysis

### 3. 1. Cluster Analysis

* Back to the main menu of the layers, select the ``customer_home_locations`` layer and click on ``ADD ANALYSIS`` option.

* From the analysis menu, select the ``Calculate cluster points`` analysis and click on ``ADD ANALYSIS``.

![cluster](imgs/portland/03-analysis.png)


* In the ``ANALYSES`` tab of the layer, we have three sections:
  * **Workflow**: Is an overview of the analysis that we apply to the layer, so you can have more than one. The analysis should have the name ``A1`` to indicate that is the first analysis applied to the layer.
  * **Source**: asks for the geometry where we will calculate the cluster of the ``customer_home_locations`` layer.
  * **Parameters**: Define the number of possible stores that you want. We set the number of clusters to 6.

* After clicking ``Apply``, CARTO will return the result of the ``Calculate cluster points`` analysis. After finishing the analysis, CARTO will return the same number of points on the map, but with an extra column called ``cluster_no``.
* In order to have a better understanding of the result of the ``Calculate cluster points`` analysis and see how the points are grouped, we should change the fill option of the points (in the ``Style`` tab) according to the value of the ``cluster_no`` column using the ``BY VALUE`` option:

### 3. 2. Weight Centroid Analysis

* We will apply the analysis to the  result of the ``Calculate cluster points``  analysis, so we will go back to the main menu and we will  click on the ``ADD ANALYSIS`` option of the ``customer_home_locations`` layer.
* We will select the ``Find centroid of geometries`` analysis.

![centroid](imgs/portland/06-centroids.png)

* In the ``ANALYSES`` tab of the layer, we have two sections:
  * **Workflow**: Now, because we are applying a second analysis to the ``customer_home_locations`` layer, the workflow has changed. ``A1`` represent the cluster analysis, but now we have a new analysis named ``A2`` to indicate that is the second analysis applied to the layer.
  * **Centroid**:
    * *Source*: we indicate that we are using as the source, the results from the ``Calculate cluster points``  analysis. The source is not the original points of the layer, but the points that we got after the ``Calculate cluster points``  analysis.
  * **Parameters**: to set how we want to calculate the centroids of the cluster data. We will select the  ``Categorized by`` option using the ``cluster_no`` column, we will also select the ``Aggregated by`` parameter to aggregate  the result using the average  of the ``customer_value`` column and finally we will select the ``Weigthted by`` parameter using the ``customer_value`` column to indicate the column that we want to use to calculate the centroids of the clustered regions.

![centroid_param](imgs/portland/07-centroids.png)

* After clicking ``Apply``, we should see a result where we can see the centroids of the clustered areas from the Cluster Analysis

![centroid_result](imgs/portland/08-centroids.png)


#### 3. 2. 1. Improve visualization

* We could style our resulting points by changing the size and the color according to the resulting aggregated values.

![centroid_styled](imgs/portland/09-bubble.png)

* We also could add a popup to the layer, so for each point we can display its value. In order to do this we go to the ``Popup`` tab and we select the ``hover`` option to display the popup when we mouse over the centroids.
We select the column ``value`` to display its values in the popup.  We also will change the name that will be displayed on the popup to ``AVG. CUSTOMER VALUE``.

![popup](imgs/portland/10-popup.png)

* Back to the main menu, in the ``Layers`` tab,we drag and drop the Cluster node analysis outside of the layer (layer A1) to create a new data layer with the customer locations (layer B).By doing this, we will have on the map a layer with the clustered points and a layer with their centroids.

![drag_drop](imgs/portland/11-drag.png)

* Now, we change the name of the layers. The name of Layer A will be ``Centroids`` and the name of layer B will be ``Customer Locations``. Then, we change the style of the ``Customer Locations`` layer using the values from the column ``cluster_no`` in order to style the points depending on the cluster they belong to.

### 3. 3. Area of influence analysis

* We will apply the analysis to the  result of the Centroid Analysis.We will go back to the main menu and we will  click on the ``ADD ANALYSIS`` option of the ``Centroids`` layer (A).
* We will select the ``Create areas of influence`` analysis.

![aoi](imgs/portland/13-aois.png)


* In the ``ANALYSES`` tab of the layer, we have three sections:
  * **Workflow**: Now, because we are applying a third analysis to the ``Centroids`` layer, the workflow has changed. ``A1`` represent the cluster analysis, ``A2`` represent the Centroid analysis and ``A3`` indicates the third analysis applied to the layer.
  * **Create areas of influence**:
    * *Input*: we indicate that we are using as the input, the results from the ``Centroid`` analysis. The input is not the original points of the layer, but the points that we got after the ``Centroid`` analysis.
  * **Parameters**: define the distance of the area of influence, the type of units, the radius and the boundaries. The boundaries might be ``intact`` or ``dissolved``. If we choose the ``intact`` option, that means that if our areas of influence polygons overlap, then they will keep their original polygon borders. On the other hand, if we choose the ``dissolve`` option, if the areas of influence polygons overlap, they will be merged so the result will be one big polygon. We set the units to kilometres, set the radius to ``1`` kilometre and choose the ``intact`` option for the ``boundaries`` parameter.
* After clicking ``Apply``, we should see a result where we can see the areas of influence of 100 meters around the subway stations:

#### 3. 3. 1. Improve visualization

* Back to the main menu, in the ``Layers``tab,we drag and drop the Area of influence node analysis outside of layer (A3) to create a new Data layer with the areas of influence (C). The new layer (C) will have the same name as the layer A, we will change the name of layer C to ``Areas of Influence``.

![areas](imgs/portland/15-centroids.png)


### 3. 4. Filter Points in polygons analysis

* We will apply the analysis to the ``Areas of Influence`` layer, so we click ``ADD ANALYSIS`` option of that layer and we select the ``Filter points in polygons`` option.

![fpp_options](imgs/portland/16-filter.png)

* In the ``ANALYSES`` tab of the layer, we have two sections:
  * **Workflow**: Now, because we are applying a second analysis to the ``Areas of Influence`` layer, the workflow has changed. ``B1`` represent the area of influence analysis, but now we have a new analysis named ``B2`` to indicate that is the second analysis applied to the layer.
  * **Filter points in polygons**:
    * *Source*: we indicate that we are using as the source, the results from the ``area of influence`` analysis. The source is not the original points of the layer, but the polygons that we got after the ``area of influence`` analysis.
    * **Target Layer**: is the ``Clusters`` layer (B1).

* After clicking ``Apply``, we should see a result where instead of the circles we had before on our ``Areas of Influence`` Layer, we should have now points referring to customers within those ``Areas of Influence``. The result is indicating the customers that are closer to the stores.

## 4. Widgets

### 4. 1. Formula widget

* Back to the main menu, select the WIDGETS tab and select the ADD WIDGET option.
* In the options of the Formula tab, select the ``cartodb_id``column of the B1 layer and we click on ``CONTINUE``.

![wid1_option](imgs/portland/18-widgets.png)


* In the widget menu, we set the ``OPERATION`` parameter to ``count`` and we change the name of the widget to ``Total Customers``.

![wid1_result](imgs/portland/19-widgets.png)

* Back to the main menu, select the WIDGETS tab and select the ADD WIDGET option.
* In the options of the Formula tab, select the ``cartodb_id``  of the C2 layer.

![wid2_option](imgs/portland/20-widgets.png)


* In the widget menu, we set the ``OPERATION`` parameter to ``count`` and we change the name of the widget to ``Customers within Areas of influence``.

![wid2_result](imgs/portland/21-widgets.png)

### 4. 2. Histogram widget

* Back to the main menu, select the WIDGETS tab and select the ADD WIDGET option.
* In the options of the Histogram tab, select the ``customer_value`` of the B1 layer and we click on ``CONTINUE``.

![wid3_option](imgs/portland/22-widgets.png)


* We should get a "U shape" histogram:

![wid3_result](imgs/portland/23-widgets.png)


* Go back to the main menu, and filter your map with the histogram. Watch how the map changes !
